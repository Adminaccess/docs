Users have grown accustomed to having push notifications be a part of virtually every app that they use. \n\nFor an app, the most effective way to receive push notifications is via Firebase Cloud Messaging Service. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost. Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification messages to drive user re-engagement and retention.\n\nThe module that we have developed, contains a functionality to generate notifications received via FCM and also generate push notifications from within the app.\n\n\n### Setting up Module into your Project\n\n1.  Unzip the github project to a folder. You can find the github repository at this link. (Insert repo. link here). Download it as zip locally and then unzip the root directory.\n2.  Launch Android Studio. Open the main project where you are to integrate these modules. \n3.  If you have not customworkmanager/commons module in the project, you would need to integrate these first sequentially, to integrate the notifications_module later, using the following steps.\n4.  Click on your app module. Select New Module Option -> Select Import Gradle Project -> Go to the downloaded project directory -> Select the module, sync your gradle. In case you face dependency resolution errors, please see the downloaded project's main app and project gradle to see what dependencies you are missing.\n5.  Please follow the same steps for the integration of notifications_module.\n\n\n### Using the functionalities to run the Module\n\n1. You must have firebase set up for your project. Set up Firebase and the FCM SDK. If you haven't already, [add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).\n2. In your project-level build.gradle file, make sure to include Google's Maven repository in both your buildscript and allprojects sections.\n3. Add the dependency for the Cloud Messaging Android library to your module (app-level) Gradle file (usually app/build.gradle)\n")),Object(a.b)("p",null,"implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:20.1.5'"),Object(a.b)("pre",null,Object(a.b)("code",Object(o.a)({parentName:"pre"},{}),"  4.

If you want to target single devices or create device groups, you'll need to access this token by extending  [`FirebaseMessagingService`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessagingService)  and overriding  `onNewToken`.
