By 2016, India had witnessed the large scale adoption of Aadhaar, one of the world’s most complex biometric systems, built using a scalable and OpenSource architecture[^1]. Simultaneously, the potential of governments to reimagine themselves as citizen-friendly, high-tech public institutions that can deliver low-cost solutions to India’s complex challenges was becoming clearer[^2]. It was against this backdrop that Samagra began its journey of democratizing technology product development for state governments with the aim to strengthen government functioning.

This post is about Samagra’s approach to building reusable OpenSource technology for state governments in India. 

Our vision has been to create a layer of reusable OpenSource technology products that will serve as the government operating system.

## Starting the journey

In 2016, our consulting teams started working with the state governments in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to manage a good governance program and to improve the quality of school education. We identified certain use cases[^2] that could be enabled by technology. At this point our approach had one key principle:

Build reusable, scalable, extensible & deployable technology products using OpenSource tools

a. Reusable: Can be reused with minimal effort for similar use cases across departments
b. Scalable: Can work well as number of users increase
c. Extensible: Can have feature additions with ease
d. Deployable: Can be easily deployed on government infrastructure by government teams as opposed to having rigid deployments on specific or proprietary infrastructure

Our approach was influenced by the need to empower government engineering teams with technology products built using OpenSource tools that they could independently manage in the long term.[^4]

We began building prototypes for these use cases. Often, a prototype helps government stakeholders to precisely imagine and articulate product requirements. For instance, we built a prototype for a scheme eligibility application that allows any citizen to update his/her basic details and get a list of schemes that s/he is eligible for and the steps to be undertaken to avail the scheme.

Within two quarters, we had built a strong MVP[^5] culture in the team and developed a few prototypes that we took to the state governments we had been working with. The feedback from the government indicated that we needed to delve deeper and understand variables that influence the deployment of these products within the governance ecosystem. We decided to get our hands dirty.

## Getting our hands dirty

In early 2017 we had the opportunity to set up the [Digital Haryana Cell](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/digital-haryana-roadmap-to-enable-easy-governance-117022100933_1.html), to design and implement the digital roadmap of the state. The primary objective was to improve the speed and efficiency of government service delivery and to increase transparency and accountability within the system[^6].

Later in 2017, we started working with the Odisha State Agriculture Department[^7] to build a Decision Support System to empower the department to make data-backed policy and strategy decisions. We worked closely with the department to use technology to streamline supply chains for raw materials, provide customised pest advisories and deliver information about markets to farmers.

Through this period of 2017-18, we witnessed an increase in the use of technology across our other engagements in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.

These experiences allowed us to:
1. Design and implement large scale, digital-first, greenfield technology projects
2. Review and improve implementation of existing government technology initiatives, and
3. Understand the challenges and opportunities of technology product management within the governance ecosystem

We now had a clear perspective of the different challenges governments face while conceptualizing, building, deploying and sustaining technology projects. It also answered a lot of our questions about why[^8] certain government technology products:
- with similar specifications are developed independently by different departments without any communication with each other
- are built by one private company for a particular department only to be rebuilt by another private company a few years later
- continue to be used at scale within the governments, even when the users are extremely unhappy with the product
- are never heard of after they are launched
- often have a long go-to-market time period
- do not have any metrics of system performance 
- have limited extensibility to include more use cases

After getting our hands dirty it was time to renew our focus on the vision with which we started this journey - to create a layer of reusable OpenSource technology products that will serve as the government operating system. This time around, we defined a structured approach to achieve our vision.

This approach had three key principles:
1. Build reusable, scalable, extensible & deployable technology products using OpenSource tools
2. Work with existing government systems, don’t replace them
3. Strengthen government technology capability, don’t replace it
