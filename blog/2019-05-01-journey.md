By 2016, India had witnessed the large scale adoption of Aadhaar, one of the world’s most complex biometric systems, built using a scalable and OpenSource architecture[^1]. Simultaneously, the potential of governments to reimagine themselves as citizen-friendly, high-tech public institutions that can deliver low-cost solutions to India’s complex challenges was becoming clearer. It was against this backdrop that Samagra began its journey of democratizing technology product development for state governments with the aim to strengthen government functioning.

This post is about Samagra’s approach to building reusable OpenSource technology for state governments in India. 

Our vision has been to create a layer of reusable OpenSource technology products that will serve as the government operating system.
